# SimpleDiscordUpdater

## Why does this exist?
This exists out of the sheer annoyance of having to contstantly download and manually install Discord on linux every *single* ***TIME*** a new update was released. So this script takes that and makes it only a simple click

## How does it work? 
Simply clone this repository and enter the directory. Then you simply run `./discord-updater' and it will download and install the latest Discord version.

## What distros does this work on?
Ubuntu, Debian, Mint, and other distributions that rely on the dpkg package manager and the .deb package format.
